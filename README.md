# Customer Segmentation and Target Market (RFM & Decile Analysis)

## 📌 Problem Statement

In the competitive e-commerce industry, understanding customer preferences, behavior, and value is crucial for optimizing strategies. Despite vast transactional data, businesses often struggle to segment customers effectively.
This project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and decile ranking to:

- Identify high-value vs. low-value customers
- Improve retention and engagement strategies
- Optimize marketing budget allocation
- Enable data-driven decision-making

## 🎯 Objectives

- Customer Value Analysis – Identify top revenue-generating customers and low-value segments.
- Retention & Engagement – Build strategies for loyal, mid-tier, and dormant customers.
- Marketing Optimization – Allocate resources effectively across segments.
- Strategic Deciling – Rank customers into 10 deciles for actionable insights.

## 📊 Deliverables

- RFM Segmentation Report – Categorized customers (top spenders, loyal, occasional, dormant).
- Decile Analysis – Ranked customer hierarchy with revenue & transaction contributions.
- Actionable Recommendations – Engagement, retention, and win-back strategies.
- Budget Allocation Framework – Proportional spend across deciles for maximum ROI.
- Dashboards & Visualizations – Power BI reports showing customer trends and revenue contributions.
- Technical Blueprint – Explanation of data cleaning, RFM calculation, and deciling process using SQL, Excel, and Power BI.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- SQL → Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation
- Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Power Pivot) → Analysis & intermediate reporting
- Power BI → Interactive dashboards and visualizations

## 🎯 Key Insights Delivered:
This analysis transformed raw transaction data into a strategic roadmap, identifying critical opportunities for growth and efficiency. The core insights include:

**1. The 80/20 Rule is Dominant**

**Finding:** A mere **20%** of the customer base (the "Champions" segment) drives **over 75%** of total revenue.

**Implication:** Marketing and retention strategies must be disproportionately focused on protecting and nurturing this highly valuable segment, as they represent the company's most significant asset and risk.

**2. Significant Revenue is Recoverable**

**Finding:** The **"At-Risk"** segment (21% of customers) represents a pool of previously loyal customers who are becoming inactive.

**Implication:** This group represents a high-potential, low-hanging fruit for **win-back campaigns**. A small nudge could recover significant revenue at a lower cost than acquiring new customers.

**3. The Largest Segment is the Least Valuable**

**Finding:** The **"Dormant"** segment is the largest (35.5% of customers) but contributes the least (3.3% of revenue).

**Implication:** Broad, untargeted marketing efforts are wasted on this group. Resources should be shifted to higher-value segments, and outreach here should be automated and low-cost.

**4. Clear ROI Framework for Budget Allocation**

**Finding:** Customer value is not evenly distributed, and neither should the budget be.

**Implication:** The data justifies a proposed budget reallocation: **50% to Champions** (Retention), **25% to Loyal Customers** (Growth), **15% to At-Risk** (Win-Back), and **10% to Dormant** (Low-Cost Nurture). This model maximizes Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI).

## 📌 Conclusion

By leveraging **RFM segmentation and decile analysis**, this project provides a **data-driven framework** for enhancing customer retention, optimizing marketing budgets, and improving overall profitability for e-commerce businesses.
